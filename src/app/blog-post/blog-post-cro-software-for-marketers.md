**Subheading**: How Marketers Use CRO Tools

Marketers use CRO tools to:
- Try different versions of a page
- See where users click or leave
- **Personalize content** based on visitor behavior
- Collect feedback and measure what works

**Note**: Although CRO covers many areas, this guide focuses on tools that let you A/B test and personalize (because these are the core of **conversion-focused marketing**).
